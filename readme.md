# 4Ô∏è‚É£ IAM & AWS CLI 
### IAM = Identity and Access Management (_Global Service_)
## üü® Consists of
- Root account (_Shouldn't be used or shared_)
- Users
- Groups
  - Can only contain users, not other groups 
  - Users can belong to multiple groups 
## üü® Policies (_Permissions_)
A JSON document that defines what a user/group is allowed to do
- Least privilege principle
  - Don't give more permission than a user needs 
- Inline policies
  - User-specific policies 
- Structure
  - Sid
    - Identifier for the statement (_optional_)
  - Effect
    - Whether to allow or deny access
      - Allow
      - Deny
  - Principle
    - To what this policy applies to
      - Account
      - User
      - Role
  - Action
    - List of actions allowed or denied
  - Resources
    - List of resources the actions are applied to
  - Condition
    - Conditions for when this policy is in effect (_optional_)
```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy",
                "iam:GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy",
                "iam:SimulateCustomPolicy",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
## üü® IAM Password Policy
- Minimum length 
- Require specific char types 
  - Include uppercase 
  - Include lowercase 
  - Numbers 
  - Non-alphanumeric  
- Allow all IAM users to change their own password 
- Password Expiration: Require users to change their password 
- Prevent password re-use
## üü® MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
- Virtual MFA Device 
  - Google Authenticator 
  - Authy 
- U2F = Universal 2nd factor Security Key 
  - YubiKey by Yubico 3rd party 
- Hardware Key Fob MFA Device

  - Lambda Function Roles 
  - Roles for CloudFormation 
- Only Roles for AWS Services is required to know for the exam
## üü® IAM Security Tools 
- IAM Credentials Report (_account level_)
  - A report that lists all accounts users and the status of various credentials 
- IAM Access Advisor (_user level_)
  - Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when they were last accessed 
  - Use information to revise policies 
## üü® Best Practices
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user **==** One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce MFA
- Use Access Keys for programmatic access (_CLI/SDK_)
- Audit permissions of your account using
  - IAM Credentials Report
  - IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & access keys
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Fundamentals
## üü• OS
- Linux 
- Windows 
- Mac OS
## üü• Storage 
- Network attached 
  - EBS 
  - EFS

  - EC2 Instance Store
## üü• User Data (scripts) 
- Bootstrap instances ‚Äì launch commands when machine starts 
  - Install updates 
  - Install software 
  - Download common files 
- Runs as root user
## üü• Instance Types (_Focus on names not examples_) 
### Naming Convention
- m5.2xlarg
  - m (_instance class_)
  - 5 (_generation, AWS imrpoves over time_)
  - 2xlarge (_size within the instance class_)
### Types
- General Purpose 
  - Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers 
  - Balance between 
    - Compute 
    - Memory 
    - Networking 
- Compute Optimized 
  - Batch processing workloads 
  - Media transcoding 
  - High performance web servers 
  - High performance computing (HPC) 
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning 
  - Dedicated gaming servers

## üü• Security Groups
- Network security in AWS 
- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 Instances 
- Only contains "allow" keys 
- Security groups can reference by IP or by security groups 
- They regulate 
  - Ports 
  - IP ranges 
  - Inbound network 
  - Outbound network 
- Components 
  - Type ‚Äì ex = HTTP 
  - Protocol ‚Äì ex = TCP 
  - Port Range ‚Äì ex = 80 
  - Source ‚Äì ex = 0.0.0.0/0 
  - Description ‚Äì ex = test http page 
- Good to know 
  - Can be attached to multiple instances 
  - Locked down to a region / VPC 
  - Good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 
  - All inbound is blocked by default 
  - All outbound is authorized by default
  - Any time you face a timeout trying to access an EC2 instance, check the Security Group
  - Never enter your IAM security keys into an EC2 instance, anyone with access to the instance can retreive the keys
    - Instead use IAM Roles
- Classic Ports to know (_Important for exam_) 
  - **3389** = RDP to login from a Windows instance
  - **22** = SSH log into Linux instance + SFTP 
  - **21** = FTP File Transfer Protocol 
  - **80** = HTTP  
  - **443** = HTTPS

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Instance Storage
## üü© EBS (_Network Drives_)
- Each volume can be attached to one instance except io1/io2 
- Volume Types 
  - Gp2/gp3 (SSD) balanced price/performance 
    - **EBS IOPS peaks at 16,000 IOPS** 
    - gp3 Can increase IOPS and Throughput **independantly** while in gp2 they are **linked together**
  - io1/io2 (SSD) highest performance 
    - Suits critical business applications 
    - Databases workloads 
    - **For over 32,000 to 64,000 IOPS we need Nitro EC2** 
    - **EBS Muti-Attach**
      - Attach same EBS to multiple EC2 **instances in the same AZ**
      - **Up to 16 EC2 instances at the same time**
      - Higher application availability 
      - Application must manage concurrent write ops 
  - st1 (HDD) low cost 
  - sc1 (HDD) lowest cost 
  - NOTE: **Only SSD can be used as boot volumes**
- Snapshots
  - Transfer EBS Volume from one AZ to another
## üü© EC2 Instance Store (_Hardware Disk_) 
- **Better I/O performance (IOPS of 310,000)**
- **Ephemeral: lost on instance stop**
- Good for buffer cache temporary  
- Risk of Data loss 
## üü© EFS: Elastic File System (_Managed File System_) 
- **Works with EC2 instances in muti-AZ**
- Highly available, scalable, expensive 
- Use cases 
  - CMS 
  - Data sharing 
  - WordPress 
- Uses Security group to control access 
- **Only Linux based AMI**
- **Encryption at rest through KMS**
- Standard file API 
- **Scale**
  - 1000s of concurrent NFS clients 
  - Grow to petabyte-scale network file system, automatically 
- **Performance Mode (_set at creation time_)**
  - General Purpose: latency-sensitive use cases (web server, cms, etc..) 
  - Max I/O: higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing) 
- **Throughput mode**
  - Bursting (1TB = 50MiB/s + burst of up to 100MiB/s) Scale with system file size 
  - Provisioned: set throughput regardless of storage size 
  - Elastic: automatically scale throughput up and down based on workload
- **Storage Classes**
  - Storage Tiers 
    - Standard 
    - Infrequent: (EFS-IA) 
      - Lifecycle policy: if not used for n days, move to EFS-IA 
  - Availability & durability 
    - Regional: Multi-AZ, great for production 
    - One Zone: great for dev, backup, compatible with IA
## üü© AMI
- AMIs are for specific regions, cannot use AMI in region A for region B
### AMI Creation Process
1. Start an EC2 instance
2. Customize it
3. Stop the instance (_for data integrity_)
4. Build an AMI from this instance (_this will also create EBS snapshots_)
5. Launch other EC2 instances from the created AMI
# 7Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Fundamentals: ELB + ASG

  - Default: 300 second
### Notes
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances 
- Single point of access (DNS) 
- Handle failures of downstream instances 
- Regular health checks 
  - When you enable ELB Health Checks, your ELB won't send traffic to unhealthy (crashed) EC2 instances. 
- SSL termination 
- Stickiness with cookies 
- High availability across zones 
- Separate public / private traffic 
## üü™ ASG: Auto Scaling Group
### Attributes

  - AMI + Instance Type 
  - EC2 User Data 
  - EBS Volumes 
  - Security Groups 
  - SSH Key Pair 
- Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity (_Target Capacity_)
- Network + Subnets Information 
- Scaling Policies 
  - Based on CloudWatch Alarms
### Rules
- Target Tracking Scaling 
  - Target Average CPU Usage 
  - Number of requests on ELB/Instance 
  - Average Network In 
  - Average Network Out 
- Simple / Step Scaling (_Custom Metric_) 
  - Number of connected users, for ex 
    - 20 < users remove 
    - users > 60 add 
  - Send custom metric from app (through PutMeticAPI) to CloudWatch 
  - Create CloudWatch alarm to react to low/ high values 
  - Use **CloudWatch alarm** as the scaling policy for ASG 
- Scheduled Actions 
  - Based on known usage patterns 
  - Example: increase min capacity from 10AM to 1PM 
- Predictive Scaling (new) 
  - Continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead
### Metrics to scale on
- CPUUItilization 
- RequestCountPerTarget 
- Average Network In/Out
### Scaling Cooldowns
- After scaling cooldown period
- Default is 300 seconds
### **Instance Refresh**
Update entire ASG based on a new launch template
- Start instance refresh
- Set a minimum healthy percentage (_how many instances can be deleted over time_)
- As instances are terminated new ones come up
- At the end all instances will have the new launch configuration
### Notes
- Creates new instances if existing ones get terminated for whatever reason like it becomes un healthy

  - 6 hours have passed since last modification 
- Maximum Storage Threshold (max limit for db storage)
### Read Replicas
- Scale your reads 
- Up to 15 read replicas within 
  - AZ (free) 
  - Cross AZ (free) 
  - Cross Region (costs replication fee) 
- Asynchronous replication 
  - Reads are eventually consistent 
  - Might read old data that is not synced at the exact second of request 
- Use case 
  - Analytics app: reads from the read replica instead of overloading app DB
- Notes 
  - Can be promoted to their own DB 
  - Applications must update connection string 
  - Only for READ, cannot update, insert, delete
### Multi AZ 
- Disaster Recovery 
- Synchronous replication 
  - Replicate every single change  
  - Replicated to other DB to be accepted 
- One DNS name -> Automatic failover 
- Increase availability 
- Notes 
  - Can read replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR) ? YES 
### Single-AZ to Multi-AZ 
- Zero downtime 
- Click modify > enable multi-AZ
### Encryption
- At Rest 
  - AWS KMS-AES-256  
  - Defined at launch time 
  - If master not encrypted, replicas cannot be encrypted 
  - TDE: Transparent Data Encryption available for Oracle and SQL Server 
- In-Flight 
  - SSL 
  - To enforce SSL 
    - PostgreSQL: 
      - Open AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups) 
      - rds.force_ssl=1 
    - MySQL: 
      - Within the DB 
      - GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
### Encrypt RDS Backup 
- Snapshot of un-encrypted = un-encrypted 
- Snapshot of encrypted = encrypted 
- Solution: Copy Snapshot into encrypted database 
  - Create snapshot of un-encrypted 
  - Copy snapshot 
  - Enable Encryption of snapshot while copying 
  - Restore database from encrypted snapshot 
  - Migrate app from old to new database
### Security 
- Better deployed within private subnet not public ones 
- Uses Security Groups, same as EC2 
- Encryption at rest using KMS 
- Encryption in flight using SSL 
### Access Management 
- IAM policies 
- Username / Password 
- IAM-based authentication 
  - Token based login 
  - Lasts 15 minutes

## ‚èπÔ∏èElastiCache 
- Managed Redis or Memcached 
  - In-memory databases with high performance low latency 
- Reduce read loads from database 
- Make app stateless 
- Sample process #1 
  - App > cache >  
    - Found > return 
    - Not found > fetch from db > write to cache 
  - Make sure cache is uptodate 
- Sample process #2 
  - Save user session to cache 
  - User calls another instance 
  - User still logged in cause session is fetched from cache 
- Redis 
  - Multi AZ 
  - Auto failover 
  - Read replicas (HA) : 0-5 
  - Data durability 
  - Backup/restore 
- Memcached 
  - Multi-node partitioning of data (sharding) 
  - No HA (Replication) 
  - No persistence 
  - NO backup/restore 
  - Multi-threaded
### Strategies
- **Lazy loading**: (Cache-aside/Lazy population) 
  - Sample process #1 
    1. Cache hit
    2. Result Returned
  - Sample process #2
    1. Cache miss
    2. Read from DB
    3. Write to cache
  - Pros 
    - Only requested data is cached 
    - Node failures are not fatal 
  - Cons 
    - Cache miss penalty result in 3 round trips 
    - Stale data: data can be outdated 
- **Write Through**: Add/Update cache when db is updated 
  - Process: 
    - Write to db 
      - Write to cache as well 
    - Read from cache > return 
  - Pros: 
    - No stale data = fast reads 
    - Write vs Read penalty (users expect read to take less time) 
  - Cons: 
    - Missing data until it is cached 
    - Cache chrun, a lot of data will never be read 
- **Cache Eviction + TTL** (Time-to-live) 
  - Options 
    - Delete items explicitly 
    - Evict cache on full memory (LRU) 
    - Set an item time-to-live (TTL)
- Types 
  - Cluster Mode Disabled 
    - One primary node, 0-5 replicas 
    - Asynchronous replication 
    - Primary node used for R/W 
    - Other nodes are read-only 
    - One shard, all nodes have all the data 
    - Guard against data loss 
    - Multi-AZ enabled for failover 
  - Cluster Mode Enabled 
    - Data partitioned across shards 
    - Each shard has primary and 0-5 replicas 
    - Multi-AZ enabled for failover 
    - Up to 500 nodes per cluster 
    - 0 replicas: 500 shards  
    - 1 replica: 250 shards 
    - 5 replicas: 83 shards
- Implementation consideration 
  - Data might be outdated 
  - Is it effective? 
    - Pattern: data changing slowly 
    - Anti-patterns: data changing rapidly 
  - Is data  structured well 
    - Key/value? 
    - Caching aggregation results?
## ‚èπÔ∏è Amazon MemoryDB for Redis

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ Route53
## üüß Record Types 
- A: Maps hostname to IPv4 
- AAAA: Maps hostname to IPv6 
- CNAME: maps hostname to another hostname 
  - Target domain must have A or AAAA record 
  - Cannot create CNAME for top node of DNS namespace, example: cannot create for example.com but for www.example.com  
- NS: Name Servers for the hosted zone 
  - Control how traffic is routed for a domain
## üüß Hosted Zoned 
- Container of records that defines how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains 
- Public Hosted Zones: Public domain name 
- Private Hosted Zones: only available within one or more VPC
## üüß CNAME vs Alias 
### CNAME 
- Points a hostname to any other hostname (app.domain.com => bla.anything.com) 
- Only for non-root domains (something.domain.com) 
### Alias 
- Points a hostname to an AWS Resource (app.domain.com => bla.amazon.com) 
- For non-root and root domains (domain.com = domain apex) 
- Free 
- Native health check
## üüß Routing Policies 
### Simple 
- Point to single resource (even with Alias enabled) 
- Can specify mult values, but client will choose one 
- **No healthchecks**
### Weighted 
- % of requests to  resource 
- Traffic % = weight for record / sum of all weights of all records 
- % does not end at 100 
- **DNS records must have same name and type**
- Can have healthchecks 
- If one record's weight is 0, it will have no traffic 
- If all records' weight is 0, all will have equal traffic 
- Usecases: 
  - Load balancing 
  - Testing new app versions by sending a small amount of traffic 
### Latency 
- Can have healthchecks 
- **Can have failover**
- Usecases: 
  - Helpful when latency for users is priority 
  - Germany users may be directed to US (if that is the lowest latency) 
### Failover 
- Must have primary & secondary types 
- Must be associated with a health check 
- If primary health check fails client will get the secondary (disaster recovery instance) 
### Geolocation 
- Based on user location ‚Äì NOT LATENCY 
- Specify location by 
  - Continent 
  - Country 
  - US Satet 
- If overlapping exist, most precise location will be selected 
- Can be associated with health checks 
- Use cases 
  - Website localization 
  - Restricting content 
  - Load balancing 
### Geoproximity (_Region Biased_)
- Route traffic based on user location and resources location 
- Bias: shifts traffic based on this number's value 
  - Expand: 1 to 99 
  - Shrink: -1 to ‚Äì99 
- Example: 
  - AWS resources (specify region) 
  - Non-AWS (specify Lat Lon) 
- Use case: 
  - **Shift traffic from one region to another by increasing the bias**
### IP Based
Define the routing based on the client IP addresses
- Define a list of Siders (_ip ranges_)
- base on the Sider which location traffic should be sent to
- Use cases
  - Optimize performance
  - Reduce network costs
- Example
  - If you know a specific ISP that are using a specific siders of IP Adresses
  - Route users to a specific endpoint
### Multi Value 
- Route traffic to multiple resources 
- Can have health checks, while Simple cannot 
- 1-8  healthy records 
- Only healthy will be returned to client 
- Is not a substitute for ELB, it is a client side load balancing
## üüß Traffic Flow 
- GUI editor for complex configuration 
- Configurations saved as Traffic Flow Policy 
- Can be applied to different Hosted Zones (domain names) 
- Supports Versioning 
- Costs money! 
- **Very useful with Geoproximity**
## üüß Health Checks  
HTTP health checks are only for public resources 
### Types 
- **Monitors an endpoint**
  - Example:
    - App 
    - Server 
    - Other AWS resource 
  - Process: 
    - 15 Global health checkers  
    - 10 - 30 sec interval (10 sec is higher cost) 
    - **If > 18% report healthy, Route 53 consider it Healthy, else Unhealthy**
    - Can choose locations to user 
  - **Notes**:
    - Endpoint must respond with 2xx or 3xx as healthy 
    - Can pass/fail based on the text in first 5120 bytes of the response 
    - Must allow incoming requests from Route 53 health checkers in router/firewall 
- Monitors other health checks (these are named **calculated healthchecks**) 
  - Combine result of multiple health checks 
  - Can use OR, AND, or NOT 
  - Monitor up to 256 child health checks 
  - Specify number of children passes to make parent pass 
  - Use case: 
    - Perform maintenance withoutt causing all health checks to fail 
- **Monitors CloudWatch Alarms** (Full control) (good for private resources) 
  - Example: 
    - Throttles 
    - DynamoDB 
    - Alarms on RDS 
    - Custom metrics 
  - Problem: 
    - Route 53 health checks are outside VPC 
    - They cannot access private endpoints 
  - Solution: 
    - Create a CloudWatch Metric 
    - Associate a CloudWatch Alarm 
    - Create a Health Check that checks the alarm itself 
### Usecases 
- Automated DNS Failover
## üüß 3rd Party Domain Registrar 
### Process 
1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53 
2. Update NS Records on 3rd party website to user Route 54 Name Servers
