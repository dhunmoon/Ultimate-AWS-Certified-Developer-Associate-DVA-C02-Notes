# 4Ô∏è‚É£ IAM & AWS CLI 
### IAM = Identity and Access Management (_Global Service_)
## üü® Consists of
- Root account (_Shouldn't be used or shared_)
- Users
- Groups
  - Can only contain users, not other groups 
  - Users can belong to multiple groups 
## üü® Policies (_Permissions_)
A JSON document that defines what a user/group is allowed to do
- Least privilege principle
  - Don't give more permission than a user needs 
- Inline policies
  - User-specific policies 
- Structure
  - Sid
    - Identifier for the statement (_optional_)
  - Effect
    - Whether to allow or deny access
      - Allow
      - Deny
  - Principle
    - To what this policy applies to
      - Account
      - User
      - Role
  - Action
    - List of actions allowed or denied
  - Resources
    - List of resources the actions are applied to
  - Condition
    - Conditions for when this policy is in effect (_optional_)
```JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy",
                "iam:GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy",
                "iam:SimulateCustomPolicy",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
## üü® IAM Password Policy
- Minimum length 
- Require specific char types 
  - Include uppercase 
  - Include lowercase 
  - Numbers 
  - Non-alphanumeric  
- Allow all IAM users to change their own password 
- Password Expiration: Require users to change their password 
- Prevent password re-use
## üü® MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
- Virtual MFA Device 
  - Google Authenticator 
  - Authy 
- U2F = Universal 2nd factor Security Key 
  - YubiKey by Yubico 3rd party 
- Hardware Key Fob MFA Device 
  - Provided by Gemalto 3rd party 
- Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud (US) 
  - Provided by SurePassID 3rd party
## üü® CLI = Command Line Interface 
- Access Keys are generated through AWS Console 
- Users manage their own access keys 
- Don't share access keys! 
  - Access Key ID ~ username 
  - Secret Access Key ~ Password 
## üü® CloudShell 
- A browser-based shell with AWS CLI access from the AWS Management Console
- Not available everywhere
## üü® IAM Roles 
- To be used by AWS Servies to perform actions 
- Common Roles 
  - EC2 Instance Roles 
  - Lambda Function Roles 
  - Roles for CloudFormation 
- Only Roles for AWS Services is required to know for the exam
## üü® IAM Security Tools 
- IAM Credentials Report (_account level_)
  - A report that lists all accounts users and the status of various credentials 
- IAM Access Advisor (_user level_)
  - Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when they were last accessed 
  - Use information to revise policies 
## üü® Best Practices
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user **==** One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce MFA
- Use Access Keys for programmatic access (_CLI/SDK_)
- Audit permissions of your account using
  - IAM Credentials Report
  - IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users & access keys
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Fundamentals
## üü• OS
- Linux 
- Windows 
- Mac OS
## üü• Storage 
- Network attached 
  - EBS 
  - EFS 
- Hardware 
  - EC2 Instance Store
## üü• User Data (scripts) 
- Bootstrap instances ‚Äì launch commands when machine starts 
  - Install updates 
  - Install software 
  - Download common files 
- Runs as root user
## üü• Instance Types (_Focus on names not examples_) 
### Naming Convention
- m5.2xlarg
  - m (_instance class_)
  - 5 (_generation, AWS imrpoves over time_)
  - 2xlarge (_size within the instance class_)
### Types
- General Purpose 
  - Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers 
  - Balance between 
    - Compute 
    - Memory 
    - Networking 
- Compute Optimized 
  - Batch processing workloads 
  - Media transcoding 
  - High performance web servers 
  - High performance computing (HPC) 
  - Scientific modeling & machine learning 
  - Dedicated gaming servers 
- Memory Optimized 
  - High performance for in-memory databases (Business intelligence BI) 
  - Distributed web scale cache stores 
  - Real-time processing of big unstructured data 
- Storage Optimized 
  - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) 
  - Data warehousing applications 
  - Distributed systems
## üü• Security Groups
- Network security in AWS 
- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 Instances 
- Only contains "allow" keys 
- Security groups can reference by IP or by security groups 
- They regulate 
  - Ports 
  - IP ranges 
  - Inbound network 
  - Outbound network 
- Components 
  - Type ‚Äì ex = HTTP 
  - Protocol ‚Äì ex = TCP 
  - Port Range ‚Äì ex = 80 
  - Source ‚Äì ex = 0.0.0.0/0 
  - Description ‚Äì ex = test http page 
- Good to know 
  - Can be attached to multiple instances 
  - Locked down to a region / VPC 
  - Good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 
  - All inbound is blocked by default 
  - All outbound is authorized by default
  - Any time you face a timeout trying to access an EC2 instance, check the Security Group
  - Never enter your IAM security keys into an EC2 instance, anyone with access to the instance can retreive the keys
    - Instead use IAM Roles
- Classic Ports to know (_Important for exam_) 
  - **3389** = RDP to login from a Windows instance
  - **22** = SSH log into Linux instance + SFTP 
  - **21** = FTP File Transfer Protocol 
  - **80** = HTTP  
  - **443** = HTTPS 
- **NEVER** USE KEYS IN Instance Connect 
  - Instead use/attach IAM Role to EC2 Instances
